The balloon project is the first step to go to space. This project will lead to the development of key features which would be later required by my rocket.

#### Objectives
1. Record altitude and acceleration during the whole flight
2. Transmit those data in flight
3. Auto lift off, reach to target altitude, and soft landing

#### New systems involved
- Master Chief System (MCS): coordinator systems during flight
- Sensor Management System (SMS): capture and record various data from sensors
- Telemetry Streaming System (TSS): stream data to ground station (via 4G connexion)

#### New on board tools (in comparison to previous step)
- Altimeter
- Accelerometer
- 4G antenna
