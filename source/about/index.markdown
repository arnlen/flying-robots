## Why this website?

The idea behind this website is to help me achieve my long term goal: creating a flying rocket. Because it's a huge challenge, which would take a lot of time, I decided to create this blog in order to monitor my progress, to write down where I've managed to get, and to share my experiences.
You can see this blog as a logbook and a motivational tool. :)

## Why creating flying robots?

Two main reasons:

1. Because we can.
2. Because flying things are **waaaaaay** much fun and exciting than walking, rolling, crawling ones, right?

The ultimate goal, of course, is to create a rocket.
Why a rocket ?
Well...

(Yes, I know: to quote oneself is totally egocentric... hum... it's like a writing selfie)

## Who am I?

My name is Arnaud Lenglet. I live in France, near Paris. I'm a developer for years, and I quitted in 2015 the employee status to embrace [the freelancer one].
Since then, I really enjoy the time I get to realise my dreams!

Entrepreneur at heart, I love creating things, learning stuff, participate to innovating and exciting projects, and sharing great talks and experiences with other *not-so-crazy* passionate guys.

Oh! And I'm a space and robotics enthusiast.

When I code: I search solutions, I take my head into my hands, I cry and I laugh, and I go to bed after a success (or not...).

When I don't write code: I go to meetups in Paris, I tinker my Rasbperry Pi and fiddle my Arduino, I prepare my next talk, or I play Kerbal Space Program.

On the weekend, I switch my code lines with the fireman uniform.

One day, I'll travel through the stars with a robot as my assistant. On this day: I'll have to write a blog post about this.
That's also why [I've started this blog].
