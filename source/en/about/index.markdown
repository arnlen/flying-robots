Hi! So you want to know more about this blog? Glad to ear that! This blog was created in 2015. Its first purpose is to help me to shape one of my dreams: **the creation my own autonomous rocket**.

Because it's a huge challenge, which would take a lot of time and efforts, I decided to monitor my progress, writing down here where I've managed to get, and to share my experiences. You can see this blog as a logbook and a motivational tool. :)

## Why creating flying robots?

Flying things are great, right? And robots are awesome. So flying robots must be - of course - amazing! Pure logic.
Another reason? Because flying things are **waaaaaay** much fun and exciting than walking, rolling, crawling ones. And where is excitement, is the power to move mountains!


## Why a rocket ?

As a well known and pretty cool guy once said:

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rocket lift off is definitely the coolest, most impressive and most exciting tech event to see on this planet! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/space?src=hash">#space</a> <a href="http://t.co/q9fg58QhJt">pic.twitter.com/q9fg58QhJt</a></p>&mdash; Arnaud Lenglet (@arnlen) <a href="https://twitter.com/arnlen/status/618882520679997445">8 Juillet 2015</a></blockquote>

## More about me

I live in France, near Paris. I quitted in 2015 the employee status to embrace the freelancer one. Since then, I really enjoy the time I get to realise my dreams!

Developer for years, entrepreneur at heart, I love creating and hacking things, learning stuff, participate to innovating and exciting projects, and sharing great talks and experiences with other *not-so-crazy* passionate guys.
When it comes to robots - and especially space ones - I can become mad very fast!

Oh! And I have a robotic dog. His name is Aciou.
