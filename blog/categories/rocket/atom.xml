    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on the <a href="/blog/2015/07/30/telemetry-streaming-system-tss-design">Telemetry Streaming System (TSS)</a>, I realised I was in need of something more. I don&rsquo;t only need a software to receive and store telemetry data ; but I need a more global system, which would allow me <strong>to monitor the whole flight</strong>.
From the lift-off until the final landing (or crash&hellip;) through various in-flight milestones and operations, I need something like a flight tower control.</p>

<p>In fact, space agencies call this the <strong>Mission Control Center</strong>.</p>

</p>


<p>In my case, I won&rsquo;t have to build a huge high-tech room, and filling it up with shiny computers and smart guys.
Rather that, what I precisely need is a software capable of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monitor the robot (balloon, zeppelin, plane, drone of rocket) on the launch pad</li>
<li>Supervise and run the launch sequence through its successive stages until lift-off</li>
<li>Monitor the flying robot during the accomplishment of its in flight missions</li>
<li>Receive and send data from and to the flying machine</li>
<li>Localize the robot once landed</li>
</ol>


<p>Because this Mission Control Center is not precisely part of my future rocket, I neglected it until now&hellip; whereas it&rsquo;s definitely a requirement for every flight!
How did I missed it?!</p>

</p>


<p>This is the good thing with iterations: each iteration helps to determine the next one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so exciting! On this first &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; iteration, I&rsquo;m discovering so many things right now! It&rsquo;s amazing!</p>

<p>Here are a few details of the Mission Control Center software I&rsquo;m actually developing, and what will be under the hood:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>An API</strong> developed in Ruby on Rails. This part would do all the core business jobs.</li>
<li><strong>A frontend</strong> developed in EmberJS. This would be the monitor part, from which I would be able to interact with the flying robot.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can follow the progress of both of these projects on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/flying-robot-projects">GitHub page of the Flying Robot Project organization</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about this for years, and this is it: with this blog, I officially launch my rocket project! The goal of this project is to create a rocket, within <strong>july 2016</strong>, which would be able to reach an altitude of <strong>1 000 m, take a picture of the launch pad when at apoapsis, and land softly in order to be recovered</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I know this goal involved huge difficulties. That&rsquo;s why I decided to split it into multiple steps.</p>

<p>Here is the first roadmap which involved 4 steps:</p>

<p class="image center">
  <img src="http://flying-robot-projects.net/images/2015/07/Flying-Robots-One-Year-Rocket-Project-Roadmap-by-Arnaud-Lenglet.jpg">
</p>


<p>The idea is that each step is designed to lead to the next one, by adding new sensors and systems to the stack.
The revised roadmap now includes 5 major steps:</p>

<hr />

<h3>Step 1: Balloon project</h3>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<ol>
<li>Record altitude and acceleration during the whole flight</li>
<li>Transmit those data in flight</li>
<li>Auto lift off, reach to target altitude, and soft landing</li>
</ol>


<h4>New systems involved</h4>

<ul>
<li>Master Chief System (MCS): coordinator systems during flight</li>
<li>Sensor Management System (SMS): capture and record various data from sensors</li>
<li>Telemetry Streaming System (TSS): stream data to ground station (via 4G connexion)</li>
</ul>


<h4>New on board tools (in comparison to previous step)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Altimeter</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>4G antenna</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Step 2: Zeppelin project</h3>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<ol>
<li>Transmit orders from ground station to flying robot</li>
<li>Manage to navigate in straight line and achieve multiple turns</li>
<li>Manage to maintain direction an altitude</li>
</ol>


<h4>New systems involved</h4>

<ul>
<li>Remote guidance system (RGS): get orders from base station</li>
<li>Position &amp; Navigation System (PNS): manage position, horizontal/vertical speed, altitude, roll, yaw and pitch</li>
<li>Energy &amp; Propulsion System (EPS): manage battery, fuel and engines</li>
</ul>


<h4>New on board tools (in comparison to previous step)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Gyroscope</li>
